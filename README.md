## Model-View-ViewModel
MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel, an architectural pattern that effectively decouples the user interface (View) from the underlying business logic (Model). It inserts a mediator layer (ViewModel) to facilitate seamless communication between these components. This architectural approach fosters improved code structure, testability, and ease of maintaining Android applications.
